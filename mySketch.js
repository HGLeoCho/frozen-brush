/*
Frozen brush

Makes use of a delaunay algorithm to create crystal-like shapes.
I did NOT develop delaunay.js, and not sure who the author really is to give proper credit.

Controls:
	- Drag the mouse.
    - Press any key to toggle between fill and stroke.

Inspired by:
	Makio135's sketch www.openprocessing.org/sketch/385808
